This is the second project for the Students at Refactory Uganda and it is for learning purposes. This project will involve both a regression and a classification problem with dataset from kaggle. 
1. The project of first choice is a regression problem considering Spanish will focus on predicting the prices of different types of wine given a set of features. the dataset can be accessed here:[Spanish Wines]( https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Ffedesoriano%2Fspanish-wine-quality-dataset).
